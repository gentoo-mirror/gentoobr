On July 05, the gui-apps/yambar package was moved to the GURU overlay, mainly
because all the dependencies are actively maintained there. Today we are also
moving the dev-util/rust-analyzer package due to the request of some Gentoo
IRC channel users, so it can serve as an alternative to the already available
dev-util/rust-analyzer-bin package.
